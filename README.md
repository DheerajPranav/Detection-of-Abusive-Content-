We have collected data from twitter API using developer credentials , then dealed with imbalanced data and handled it. Then used NLP techniques to pre-process data using NLTK : removal of stop words , Lemmetization , Case conversional , Removal of links. And then Converting Data into vectors using Tf-IDF Vectorization and other word Embedding techniques. And finally feeded it to the models i.e. Shallow as well deep neural networks and achieved a decent performance on validation set.
